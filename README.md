# ðŸ‘· AA Benchmark Hardhat

A comprehensive benchmark for smart contract accounts that support account abstraction (ERC-4337), built on Hardhat for more accurate runtime execution benchmarking and use of official utilities for calculating pre-verification gas and L1 data fees. This work was inspired by ZeroDev's work on [aa-benchmark](https://github.com/zerodevapp/aa-benchmark), which is built on Foundry.
